Why study Ethics?
=================
1. To better understand your own moral viewpoint
  - diff of *reasons*
  - The Lost Wallet:
    - Mencius: return it out of sympathy. You understand the associated pain
    - Kant - return it out of duty to the Moral Law
    - Laoci - return it out of innocence (like it never occured to keep it)
2. To be better able to interact with different people and viewpoints
  - My Epiphany - people have reasons for their beliefs
  - Study ethics to understand arguments, facilitate dialogue, resolve conflict
  - NOTE: you can still have your own viewpoints
