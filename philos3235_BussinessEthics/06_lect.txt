Utilitarianism Wrapup
=====================
Principle of Utility
- Good actions increase pleasure / decrease pain
- "The greater good"

Act Utilitarians
- Apply this principle to _each_action_
- Bentham-like calculus
- There's no assumption at the outset that anything is
  prefered / off-limits (outside of utility)

Rule Utilitarians
- Don't have to "reinvent the wheel" with morality
- Societal "rules of thumb" that actually promote utility
  - don't lie, don't steal, etc
- Saves time
- Mill-like on rights

===============================================================================
Case 1 - Hermit in the Woods
----------------------------
There is a hermit who lives in the woods. He's got a bunch of gold. There is a
nearby village, currently afflicted by famine. A villager happens across the
hermit and has to decide whether or not to kill the hermit and bring the gold
back to his village.

Act Utilitarian
- Kill the hermit, steal his stuff
- If he doesn't take this action, people in his village will suffer
  when they didn't need to

Rule Utilitarian
- Doesn't kill the hermit
- Society will work better when we aren't crossing that societal boundary

===============================================================================
Case 2 - Voting
---------------
Should I vote?

Act Utilitarian
- How will my vote make the biggest impact?
- Depends where time is best spent
- Depends on if you are in a swing state - 1 vote may make the difference

Rule Utilitarian
- Yes -> It is a civic duty
- Democracy works better when people are more involved and more educated

===============================================================================
Higher / Lower Pleasures
------------------------
Bentham
- Just measure the pleasure (quantity)

Mill
- Need to discriminate between higher / lower (quality)
  - We're actually happier with higher pleasures
  - Societies that encourage higher pleasures are happier

Sandel's test (Shakespeare vs Fear Factor vs Simpsons)
- Everyone prefers Simpsons
- What can we conclude from that?
