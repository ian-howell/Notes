"Big 3" of Moral Theory
=======================
Virtue     ->      Action     ->     Consequences
(Theory)        (Deontology)         (Utilitarians)

Why Consequences?
-----------------
1. They can be studied empirically
  - people have preferences / desires
2. Rational - difference in treatment given some rational justification
3. "User-friendly" guide to morality
  - Bentham's Calculus
