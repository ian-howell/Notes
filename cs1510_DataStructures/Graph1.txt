ADT Graphs
----------
- A collection of objects with a relationship among them
- Gets rid of unneeded details (abstraction)
- Invented by Leonard Euler

Definition
----------
- A graph G = <V, E>
  - V is a set of vertices
  - E is a set of edges - An edge is a pair <u, w> in which both u and w are in
    the set V
    - If the set E is "symmetric" (ie, if <u, w> is in E then <w, u> is in E),
      then the graph is called undirected
    - The edge <u, u> is called a loop
    - A graph with no loops is called a simple graph
    - Vertex w is adjacent to vertex u if the pair <u, w> is in E
- The degree of vertex u is the number of vertices adjacent to u
- The degree of the graph is the highest degree of a vertex in G
- A path in a graph is a sequence of vertices such that <ui, ui+1> must be in
  the set E
  - example: <u0, u1, u2, u3, ... un>
  - If a path does not contain any loops, it is a simple path
  - A non-empty path has length n
- A cycle is a path where with length greater than 0 where u0 == un

Example
V = {kci, stl, lax, dfw, maa}
E = {
     <lax, kci>,
     <kci, stl>,
     <kci, dfw>,
     <dfw, maa>,
     <stl, maa>,
     <stl, lax>
    }
