Recursive Backtracking
----------------------
- Decompose into a series of trial and error tasks

try (ith step)
  initialize choices
  do
    select choice
    if choice is valid
      record choice
      if solution is complete
        return success
      else
        try (i+1)th step
        if successful
          return success
        else
          Remove choice record
  while more chocies are available
  // there are no more choices
  return failure
end
