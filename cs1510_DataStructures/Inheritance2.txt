Desctructors + Inheritance

Desctructor of a derived class runs its code, then calls the destructor
of the base class

class A
{
    int* p;
    ~A()
    {
        delete [] p;
    }
}

class B : public A
{
    string* m;
    ~B() 
    { 
        delete [] m;
        // ~A() is called here
    }
}

void foo()
{
    B ben;
}
